#print(type(var1)) this for finding the type of variable used by type funtion
#print(var2+var3)this is for calculate the veriable
#print(var1+var2) this is not the right way to add a string variable and integer veriable
#the right way is
#print(int(var1)+int(var2))
#print(10* var1)thi sthe way to type a word many times note only string words if you want to type a number like that you have to convert that number number to string
#like that
print(10*str(int(var1)+int(var2)))
#this is collrd type casting
